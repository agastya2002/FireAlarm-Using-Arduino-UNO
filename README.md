# FireAlarm-Using-Arduino-UNO
This is a simple fire alarm that uses the DHT11 sensor(for temperature) and a LDR(for light intensity) for inputs. According to the inputs the device determines if there is a fire and if so turns on a red LED and a buzzer and also sends an alert to the user's mobile using bluetooth(HC-05).
